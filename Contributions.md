Daniel (You) — Database Architecture & Optimization

Schema Design & DDL Scripting: Authored and maintained the foundational PostgreSQL database structure, encompassing custom ENUM types (booking_status, listing_status_type), custom table relations, and CASCADE deletion constraints.

Data Integrity & Spatial Querying: Built advanced PostgreSQL EXCLUDE constraints using GiST indexes to prevent double bookings, integrated PostGIS spatial data types (point, box) for location-based search, and defined views (listing_summary, view_active_bookings_with_price).

Environment & Security Troubleshooting: Resolved PostgreSQL ownership and SQLSTATE 42501/42710 privilege errors on Neon serverless PostgreSQL, ensuring safe execution without permission conflicts.

Performance Tuning & Triggers: Designed dynamic PL/pgSQL automated trigger functions (update_timestamp) and indexed foreign keys/frequently queried columns (idx_listings_search, idx_bookings_date_range).
